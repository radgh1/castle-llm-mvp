Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. AI systems can learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Key Concepts:
- Machine Learning: Algorithms that improve through experience
- Deep Learning: Neural networks with multiple layers
- Natural Language Processing: Understanding and generating human language
- Computer Vision: Interpreting visual information

AI has applications in healthcare, finance, transportation, and many other fields.
