## âš¡ Tips

**Auto-deployment:** After setting up, every time you:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your changes"
git push origin main
```

Both Netlify and Railway will **automatically redeploy** within 1-2 minutes!

**First-request delay:** Railway free tier may take 5-10 seconds on the first request (it wakes up the container). Subsequent requests are fast.

**Monitoring:** 
- Railway dashboard shows backend logs
- Netlify shows deployment status and analytics

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

1. **404 API errors** â†’ Check `VITE_API_URL` is set in Netlify
2. **CORS errors** â†’ Check `FRONTEND_URL` is set in Railway  
3. **Build fails** â†’ Check package.json for typos
4. **Backend slow** â†’ Normal on first request (cold start)

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for full troubleshooting guide.
